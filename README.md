# CLL121 - Thermodynamics Project

## Designed solution of a Steam Accumulator problem in C++ language.

### Part-1: Calculated Pressure in the final state and Volume accumulated in the accumulator using the data provided
### Part-2: Estimated minimum volume accumulated without fixing the liquid volume fraction in the final state (using a more appropriate design).
